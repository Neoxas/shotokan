  """
  A common competition kata, empi is a relatively advanced shotokan kata.
  Empi is often translated to "flying swallow" which can be seen in the dynamic nature of this kata.
  This is one of the first shotokan katas to incorporate a jumping rotation, with the others being Unsu and Kankodai.
  A key focus should be on sharp, snapping motions with strong hips.
